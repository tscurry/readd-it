# readd-it

A reddit clone with basic functionality that utilizes the Reddit JSON API to mimic the reddit website but created with minimal functionality. Some minimal functionalities include: viewing and interacting with posts from the API, searching, viewing comments and voting without the actual implementation, so it doesn't affect the overall score. 

Videos are loaded but with no audio, except those from Youtube.

## Installation

Be sure to have Node.js installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tscurry/readd-it.git

```

## Start a web server (optional)
